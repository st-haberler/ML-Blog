# Introduction - a letter to Santa Clause

This is the first in a series of articles on what the concept of AI could do for the every-day legal work. 

## My starting point
I am a legal professional, I have passed the Austrian equivalent of the bar exam and I have several years of legal practice under my belt. "Years of legal practice" means that I conducted countless court proceedings and drafted an equal amount of contracts in different fields such as commercial law, criminal law, insolvency law and real estate law. This kind of work has two sides. 

One side is well represented in Hollywood movies: exciting court hearing and thrilling negotiations. Some like to add the intellectual thrill of finding an obscure precedent that saves the day or the inner satisfaction arising from the artful creation of a new and complex contract. 

Then there is the other side no one likes to talk about. The grind. A legal practioner's day-to-day work consists of countless repeating micro steps: Keeping your files in order. Finding templates in huge collections or databases. Applying these templates. Finding the applicable law. Finding the applicable provisions within that law. Finding court decisions and expert opinions corresponding to these provisions. Applying your findings to your work. 

These are countless little steps. All of them consist mainly of manipulating information. Also they require mental focus and they add up to a lot time. 

## Where am I going? 
What if these little steps were automated? I understand that legal information retrieval has made usefuls steps into this direction. But I am asking for more than just a search assistant for decisions and legal literature. I want to be relieved of everything that is tedious (i.e. repetitive and open to automation). 

I will develop this thought together with examples in later posts. But what is more important: I will sketch my thoughts on how to realize such assistants. Because Christmas is still some time away.
