# Introduction - a letter to Santa Clause

This is the first in a series of articles on the application of the concept of machine learning on legal work. These are my thoughts at the beginning: 

Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning are buzzwords, no doubt. How did I come up with them in the first place? I am a legal professional, I have passed the Austrian equivalent of the bar exam and I have several years of legal practice under my belt. This kind of work fortunately provides many exciting moments. But, as in many other professions, there are overwhelmingly more moments of dull and repetitive work – the grind. And modern technology wasn’t particularly successful in reducing these moments. 

To me it seems as if there is a significant gap between what modern technology could do to relieve legal practitioners of such tasks and the products available for that. Here are some tools I would like to see: 
1. An app that reads a complete file and sorts it in a meaningful way. Lawyers spend a lot of time sorting their stuff. Searching a file should feel as effortless as a Google Search, both in terms of responsiveness as in relevance of the results. 
2. More often than not the problem I am working is not new. I find myself in the situation that I have to estimate whether it takes more effort to reinvent the wheel while I am on it or to spend the time to research the archive for a useful template. Both options are very tedious. The latter especially because there are no search tools which is why I find myself sifting through a heap of old files. 
3. An app that helps me through extensive regulatory bodies. Obviously they take a long time to read, change regularly and what is most annoying: due to lazy legislature the provisions contain monstrous sentences and structure. I want to ask simple questions about a law and have them answered by my app. 
4. Writing remedies like appeals involves detailed knowledge of the file. You have to carefully read a lot of documents and often end up having a big conference table full of paperwork in an attempt to see the big picture. I want an app that finds inconsistencies and other formal weak points for me. 

Of course, 1. and 2. could also be helped with a little better organization and orderliness. But things do get messy. An arduous trial session or maybe just several people working simultaneously on a file are a recipe for chaos. Not to mention that every file needs a different system and systems change over time. So why not just add documents as they come and have the app keep the order? Even a different system for every user poses no difficulty. 

A clever database system seems to be one prerequisite. But above all, these apps need to be smart as in AI. In my next text I will try to sketch out which AI techniques could fulfill this wish list.
